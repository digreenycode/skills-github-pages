I grew up stumbling upon and listening to a few Cantonese song classics, though I did not understand their meanings. Nevertheless, the richness and tonality of the language allowed the songs to convey emotions and feelings to me, making them unforgettable.  

For example, **上海滩** features a dramatic opening and in the later part, its shifting tones, from soft and reflective to powerful and commanding, create a deeply expressive and emotionally impactful experience.

### Learning Experience

Prof Sew’s class was a window of opportunity to understand what these songs meant and I enjoyed every moment when he played the songs at the beginning of the class.  

During the class, we went through common phrases and idioms as shared by our dear friend **Olivia from Hong Kong** on YouTube, while also practicing our conversational language through varying subjects and objects mentioned in Olivia’s sentences.  

In fact, this was the most creative and fun part of the class, because we use anything we like and make a fool of ourselves! And as predicted, Prof Sew will always reply with “calm down”. Perhaps, we’re too hyperactive for him.

### Remix Assignment and Interview

The remix assignment and interview was pretty fun and creative as I got to use Cantonese with my friends.  

The remix required us to make use of basic vocabulary from our toolbox to create a parody of a well known Cantonese song.  

For the interview, I did it with my friend, and it was really the blind leading the blind as we found difficulty in conversing naturally and replying instantly.  

However, the attempts made to create and carry out the conversation gave us a deeper understanding on the importance of **tonality** and **filler words** in Cantonese. These aspects of language are what makes it sound “native” or fluent.

### My Top Phrases

**唔該** – a single phrase that has universal applications in courtesy, be it saying excuse me, sorry, thank you.  

**咩** – nice short single word as compared to 什么 in Mandarin. Also, the character itself also shows you how to pronounce it, like a sheep.  

**鍾意** – very sincere word that expresses deep passion or liking in something or someone, compare this with 喜欢 in Mandarin.  

**瞓覺** – similarly, for its uniqueness in Cantonese, 瞓 not seen in Mandarin.  

**熄燈** – (vs the standard 关灯 in Mandarin) to me, this word is like a time capsule that retains the old meaning of extinguish. Reminds me of gas lamps in the past and how far humanity has progressed in electrical lighting.

Thank you Prof Sew for providing me the rare opportunity to take up a DYOC module in Cantonese, as I would never have the chance to learn this in Singapore's education system.
